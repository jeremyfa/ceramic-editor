# Ceramic Editor

An editor for [ceramic](https://github.com/ceramic-engine/ceramic) made with ceramic.

⚠️ Under active development!

### Made for ceramic, but usable with other frameworks

Although the editor's primary use is to export prebuilt visual hierarchies for ceramic apps, it exports clean JSON data that could be used with other tools as well.
